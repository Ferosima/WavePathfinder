# WavePathfinder

This project contains an implementation of the wave pathfinder algorithm. The algorithm is based on the idea of wave propagation on a two-dimensional map, where each point is a node, and the edges between the points are determined by their neighborhood. The algorithm allows you to find the optimal path between two points on the map, given obstacles and impeding conditions.
